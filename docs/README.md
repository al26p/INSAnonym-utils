## Whats is INSA'nonym-utils?

INSA'nonym-utils is a python library created to ease tables anonymization.
This project use pandas library to create Dataframes in order to be more efficient.

## Why ?

Numerous implementations can exist to anonymize an algorithm, but by expereience, they are not ideal solutions.

Certain implementations operate line by line.

Others use Dataframes, but doesn't use methods that can accelerate calculus ([comparative](https://engineering.upside.com/a-beginners-guide-to-optimizing-pandas-code-for-speed-c09ef2c6a4d6)).

### Warning

This library only has a few simple algorithms, and they are not very efficient in anonymization.
The aim of the library is to ease writing and processing algorithms on a dataframe.
